This program is terminal-implementation of [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) that uses [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell).

## Disclaimer

This project serves as an exercise for me to learn Golang - there will be a lot of cases where the program will abruptly exit.

Don't consider it stable.
